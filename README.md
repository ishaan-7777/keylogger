# Keylogger (but abit more...)

## ⚠️DISCLAIMER⚠️

This keylogger is MALICIOUS by definition. I created this as a learning experience for myself, by myself (with the help of online resources where needed). Attempting to run this may flag antivirus as malicious software, and an exception will need to be added.


## Objective

This project aimed to create a keylogger which provided more information than just keystrokes. It also generates a system_information file, which contains the users IP Address information and Hardware information.
